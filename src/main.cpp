// Random stuff

/*
 * ShowSplashScreen() -> ShowMenu()
 * 						 -> mainMenu.Show(gWindow, gRenderer, result);
 *						 -> mainMenu.Render() - its crashing here, why?
 *						 -> [x] - Fixed: it was rendering some stuff from Joystick variables that were
 *						 	      not initialized so we just commented it out.
 *
 * Other Notes:
 * - the screen is being render at 1920x1080, but we shrinking it to 1280x720
 *
